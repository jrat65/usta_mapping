Repository for KML test files

While the developers area will say it does support it, I was not able to get the kml file to be recognized from the google sites location.
Also, I was not able to it populate correctly from a public share on my dropbox account.

I was able to get it to work using a file designated as a kml and kmz frmo the ARCGis site as a public file. However, last Thursday this stopped 
functioning and I'm here today to start all over again with a git repository.

Fingers crossed.
